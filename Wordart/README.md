# Wordart project

## Description
Beginning stages of project to read various data source API's and use *amueller's* excellent [WordCloud project](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) to visualize them

## Status
* Basic class for reading New York Times' article API implemented
* Basic example implementation in `wordart_example.ipynb`
* Some example images produced

## Notes
* This is using an older version of `WordCloud`, and so mask images must be RBG with white areas definining areas *not* to draw to
